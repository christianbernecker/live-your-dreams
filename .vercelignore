# Vercel Deployment Configuration
#
# This repository uses a MONOREPO structure with separate Vercel projects:
# - apps/backoffice/ → deployed as "backoffice" project
# - design-system/ → deployed as "design-system" project
#
# DO NOT deploy from repository root (Yarn Workspaces incompatible)
# See: docs/deployment/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md

# Ignore everything at root level
*

# Root vercel.json is disabled (renamed to vercel.json.disabled)
# Each sub-project has its own vercel.json configuration
